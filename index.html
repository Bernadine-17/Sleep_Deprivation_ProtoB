Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal is to create a web-based app that helps users who are likely to be college students determine if they are sleep deprived.
 
Known Issues:
Has not yet been determined if this app can accurately diagnose sleep deprivation.
No current function to output diagnostic.
User must refresh the pape if on a mobile phone with it in a horizontal orientation to get the canvas to be the correct width

				<p>
				Sleep deprivation is known to negatively affect the mind in various ways. Saccadeds are the 
				semi-involuntary, fast movements of your eyes to focus on a new point. Although they can be controlled
				consciously, their involuntary element allows them to be a measurement tool for sleep deprivation. When 
				sleep deprived, the velocity of saccadic movements (degrees/sec) are slowed.

				<p> This app cannot measure your saccadic velocity but will measure a variation of this by recording your response time using
					horizontal eye movements to determine if you are sleep deprived or not.
					Hold your device horizontally (longways) around an arms length distance from your face and refresh the page so
					that the testing canvas appears in the correct orientation. When ready, press start 
					and stare at the red dot. A black letter will flash on either side of the dot. 
					When you see this letter, press the stop button. This will record an individual response time in seconds. 
					You will be alerted when you complete 20 trials. Find the test under the "Test" tab above or scroll down.
